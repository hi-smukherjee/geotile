GeoTile is an open source python library for creating and manipulating the tiles of the raster dataset. It is based on the `Rasterio`_ library.

.. _`Rasterio`: https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Motivation
----------

The main motivation to write this library is to make it easier to create tiles of the raster dataset as a deep learning training dataset.
Since the library is extended to the Rasterio package, it also supports some very useful raster analysis function like, reprojection of raster, resampling of raster, raster masking etc.
